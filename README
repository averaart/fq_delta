# Fq_delta
## Efficient storage of processed versions of fastq files.

Fq_delta is a python module and shell script that enables the storage of processed versions of fastq files generated by DNA and RNA sequencing technologies. By using Myer's diff algorithm that allows per-character comparisons of two strings, we generate delta files from the original and edited fastq file. While the delta files generated by fq_delta can be used to fully reconstruct the original files, they are only a fraction (0.1 â€“ 2%) of the original size. Depending on the number of processing steps, implementation of this module will lead to a significant reduction in storage required for processing sequence data.
